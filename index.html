          <p>
            I am skilled in both front-end and back-end development, allowing
            them to build complete web applications from start to finish. I work
            with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue, or
            Angular) for the front end and Node.js, Python, Ruby, or PHP for the
            back end, along with databases like MySQL or MongoDB. Full-stack
            developers handle everything from UI/UX design to server-side logic,
            APIs, and deployment, making them versatile and essential for web
            development projects.

            Python, PHP, or Ruby), databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase), and
